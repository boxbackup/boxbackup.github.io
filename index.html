			<h1>Box Backup</h1>

			<p>An open source, completely automatic on-line backup system for UNIX.
				<ul>
					<li>All backed up data is stored on the server in files on a filesystem -- no tape or archive devices are used
					<li>The server is trusted only to make files available when they are required -- all data is encrypted
					<li>A backup daemon runs on systems to be backed up, and copies encrypted data to the server when it notices changes
					<li>Only changes within files are sent to the server, just like rsync
					<li>Old versions of files on the server are stored as changes from the current version
					<li>Behaves like tape -- old versions and deleted files are available
					<li>Choice of backup behaviour, optimised for document or server backup
					<li>Designed to be easy and cheap to run a server. Portable implementation, and RAID implemented in
					userland for reliability without complex server setup or expensive hardware. (optional)
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>

			<p>There are three main elements</p>

			<ul>
				<li>bbstored -- backup store server.
				<li>bbackupd -- backup client daemon, which scans for changes and uploads them to the server.
				<li>bbackupquery -- backup query and restore tool.
			</ul>

			<p>Running the store server is a multi-step process, but the backup client is easy.</p>

			<p>TLS (SSL revised) is used to encrypt connections, and more importantly, to authenticate servers
			and clients with both server and client side certificates. Scripts are provided to generate and
			manage these certificates.</p>

			<p>Stored files are encrypted using AES for file data and Blowfish for
			metadata. This does mean that the one thing you do need to back up
			off-site and look after is a 1k file containing your keys -- the data
			on the server is useless without it. But it never changes, so that's OK.</p>
