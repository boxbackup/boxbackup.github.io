          your backups are working properly by comparing them. Box Backup
          makes this very easy and completely automatic. All you have to do is
          schedule the <span class="command"><strong>bbackupquery compare</strong></span> command to run
          regularly, and check its output. You can run the command manually as
          follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">/usr/local/sbin/bbackupquery "compare -a" quit</pre><p>This command will report all the differences found between the
          store and the files on disc. It will download everything, so may
          take a while. You should expect to see some differences on a typical
          compare, because files which have recently changed are unlikely to
          have been uploaded yet. It will also tell you how many files have
          been modified since the last backup run, since these will normally
          have changed, and such failures are expected.</p><p>You are strongly recommended to add this command as a
          <span class="command"><strong>cron</strong></span> job, at least once a month, and to check the
          output for anything suspicious, particularly a large number of
          compare failures, failures on files that have not been modified, or
          any error (anything except a compare mismatch) that occurs during
          the compare operation.</p><p>Consider keeping a record of these messages and comparing them
          with a future verification.</p><p>If you would like to do a "quick" check which just downloads
          file checksums and compares against that, then run:</p><pre class="programlisting">/usr/local/sbin/bbackupquery "compare -aq" quit</pre><p>However, this does not check that the file attributes are
          correct, and since the checksums are generated on the client they
          may not reflect the data on the server if there is a problem -- the
          server cannot check the encrypted contents. View this as a quick
          indication, rather than a definite check that your backup verifies
          correctly.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp67891280"></a>Restore backups</h4></div></div></div><p>You will need the keys file created when you configured the
          server. Without it, you cannot restore the files; this is the
          downside of encrypted backups. However, by keeping the small keys
          file safe, you indirectly keep your entire backup safe.</p><p>The first step is to recreate the configuration of the backup
          client. It's probably best to have stored the /etc/box directory
          with your keys. But if you're recreating it, all you really need is
          to have got the login infomation correct (ie the certs and
          keys).</p><p>Don't run bbackupd yet! It will mark all your files as deleted
          if you do, which is not hugely bad in terms of losing data, just a
          major inconvenience. (This assumes that you are working from a blank
          slate. If you want to restore some files to a different location,
          it's fine to restore while bbackupd is running, just do it outside a
          backed up directory to make sure it doesn't start uploading the
          restored files.)</p><p>Type:</p><pre class="programlisting">/usr/local/sbin/bbackupquery</pre><p>to run it in interactive mode.</p><p>Type:</p><pre class="programlisting">list</pre><p>to see a list of the locations stored on the server.</p><p>For each location you want to restore, type:</p><pre class="programlisting">restore name-on-server local-dir-name</pre><p>The directory specified by local-dir-name must not exist yet.
          If the restore is interrupted for any reason, repeat the above
          steps, but add the <span class="bold"><strong>-r</strong></span> flag to the
          restore command to tell it to resume.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp67897680"></a>Retrieving deleted and old files</h4></div></div></div><p>Box Backup makes old versions of files and files you have

          versions will make this far more user-friendly.</p><p>Firstly, run bbackupquery in interactive mode. It behaves in a

      corruption, for example, after an unclean shutdown or other operating
      system or hardware problem.</p><p>In general, as updates to the store are made in an atomic manner,
      the most likely result is wasted disc space. However, if really bad
      things happen, or you believe that there is a lot of wasted space, then
      these instructions will help to restore your data.</p><p>You know you will need to do something if you get strange errors,
      and bbackupd attempts to contact the server every 100 seconds or so. Or
      if one of the discs in your RAID disc set has failed.</p><p>After following these instructions, the end result will be that
      bbackupquery will be able to see all the files which were stored on your
      server, and retrieve them. Some of them may be in lost+found directories
      in the root of the store (or in their original position if they have
      been moved) but they will all be able to be retrieved.</p><p>After you have retrieved the files you want, bbackupd will upload
      new versions where necessary, and after about two days, mark any
      lost+found directories as deleted. Finally, those directories will be
      removed by the housekeeping process on the server.</p><p>These instructions assume you're working on account 1234. Replace
      this with the account number that you actually want to check (the one
      that is experiencing errors). These steps will need to be repeated for
      all affected accounts.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp67906896"></a>Stop bbackupd</h3></div></div></div><p>First, make sure that bbackupd is not running on the client
        machine for the account you are going to recover. Use
        <span class="command"><strong>bbackupctl terminate</strong></span> to stop it. This step is not
        strictly necessary, but is recommended. During any checks on the
        account, bbackupd will be unable to log in, and after they are
        complete, the account is marked as changed on the server so bbackupd
        will perform a complete scan.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp67920976"></a>Are you using RAID on the server?</h3></div></div></div><p>The raidfile recovery tools have not been written, and probably

        out of three files are available, the server will successfully allow
        access to your data, even if it complains a lot in the logs. The best
        thing to do is to fix the accounts, if necessary, and retrieve any
        files you need. Then move the old store directories aside (in case you
        need them) and start afresh with new accounts, and let the clients
        upload all their data again.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp67922128"></a>Check and fix the account</h3></div></div></div><p>First, run the check utility, and see what errors it

      the moment. This page lists some of the common errors, and the most
      likely causes of them.</p><p>When an error occurs, you will see a message like 'Exception:
      RaidFile/OSFileError (2/8)' either on the screen or in your log files.

      server setup instructions.)</p><p>This error may not be particularly helpful, although some do have
      extra information about probable causes. To get further information,
      check the ExceptionCodes.txt file in the root of the distribution. This

      run that first.</p><p>Some common causes of exceptions are listed below.</p><p>Please email me with any other codes you get, and I will let you

        build the debug version with:</p><pre class="programlisting">cd boxbackup-0.0

make</pre><p>Within the module directories, make defaults to building the
        debug version. At the top level, it defaults to release.</p><p>This will build an executable in debug/bin/bbstoreaccounts which
        you can then use instead of the release version. It will give far more
        useful error messages.</p><p>When you get an error message, use the file and line number to
        locate where the error occurs in the code. There will be comments
        around that line to explain why the exception happened.</p><p>If you are using a debug version of a daemon, these extended
