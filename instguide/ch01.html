    The store server daemon, bbstored runs on a central server. Data is sent
    to the store server, which stores all data on local filesystems, that is,
    only on local hard drives. Tape or other archive media is not used.</p><p>The system is designed to be easy to set up and run, and cheap to
    use. Once set up, there should be no need for user or administrative
    intervention, apart from usual system maintenance.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp62123600"></a>Client daemon</h2></div></div></div><p>bbackupd is configured with a list of directories to back up. It
      has a lazy approach to backing up data. Every so often, the directories
      are scanned, and new data is uploaded to the server. This new data must
      be over a set age before it is uploaded. This prevents rapid revisions
      of a file resulting in many uploads of the same file in a short period
      of time.</p><p>It can also operate in a snapshot mode, which behaves like
      traditional backup software. When instructed by an external bbackupctl
      program, it will upload all changed files to the server.</p><p>The daemon is always running, although sleeping most of the time.
      In lazy mode, it is completely self contained -- scripts running under
      cron jobs are not used. The objective is to keep files backed up, not to
      make snapshots of the filesystem at particular points in time
      available.</p><p>If an old version of the file is present on the server, a modified
      version of the rsync algorithm is used to upload only the changed
      portions of the file.</p><p>After a new version is uploaded, the old version is still
      available (subject to disc space on the server). Similarly, a deleted
      file is still available. The only limit to their availability is space
      allocated to this account on the server</p><p>Future versions will add the ability to mark the current state of
      files on the server, and restore from this mark. This will emulate the
      changing of tapes in a tape backup system.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp62126544"></a>Restoration</h3></div></div></div><p>Restoring files is performed using a query tool, bbackupquery.
        This can be used to restore entire directories, or as an 'FTP-like'
        tool to list and retrieve individual files. Old versions and deleted
        files can be retrieved using this tool for as long as they are kept on
        the server.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp62127696"></a>Client Resource Usage</h3></div></div></div><p>bbackupd uses only a minimal amount of disc space to store
        records on uploaded files -- less than 32 bytes per directory and file
        over a set size threshold. However, it minimises the amount of queries
        it must make to the server by storing, in memory, a data structure
        which allows it to determine what data is new. It does not need to
        store a record of all files, essentially just the directory names and
        last modification times. This is not a huge amount of memory.</p><p>If there are no changes to the directories, then the client will
        not even connect to the server.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp62043472"></a>Security</h2></div></div></div><p>Box Backup is designed to be secure in several ways. The data
      stored on the backup store server is encrypted using secret-key
      cryptography. Additionally, the transport layer is encrypted using TLS,
      to ensure that the communications can't be snooped.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp62044496"></a>Encryption</h3></div></div></div><p>The files, directories, filenames and file attributes are all
        encrypted. By examining the stored files on the server, it is only
        possible to determine the approximate sizes of a files and the tree
        structure of the disc (not names, just number of files and
        subdirectories in a directory). By monitoring the actions performed by
        a client, it is possible to determine the frequency and approximate
        scope of changes to files and directories.</p><p>The connections between the server and client are encrypted
        using TLS (latest version of SSL). Traffic analysis is possible to
        some degree, but limited in usefulness.</p><p>An attacker will not be able to recover the backed up data
        without the encryption keys. Of course, you won't be able to recover
        your files without the keys either, so you must make a conventional,
        secure, backup of these keys.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp62046416"></a>Authentication</h3></div></div></div><p>SSL certificates are used to authenticate clients. UNIX user
        accounts are not used to minimise the dependence on the configuration
        of the operating system hosting the server.</p><p>A script is provided to run the necessary certification
        authority with minimal effort.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp62048080"></a>Server daemon</h2></div></div></div><p>The server daemon is designed to be simple to deploy, and run on
      the cheapest hardware possible. To avoid the necessity to use expensive
      hardware RAID or software RAID with complex setup, it (optionally)
      stores files using RAID techniques.</p><p>It does not need to run as a privileged user.</p><p>Each account has a set amount of disc space allocated, with a soft
      and a hard limit. If the account exceeds the soft limit, a housekeeping
      process will start deleting old versions and deleted files to reduce the
      space used to below the soft limit. If the backup client attempts to
      upload a file which causes the store to exceed the hard limit, the
      upload will be refused.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pr01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">License </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Building and installing</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
